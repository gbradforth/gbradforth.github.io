                                    <p>I skateboard in my free time and to get around on campus. My boyfriend actually
                                        made me my longboard. He painted the pattern on the back with resin, and added a
                                        final coat of clear resin on top to protect it. I want to learn some tricks on
                                        my skateboard, but I mostly just use it to get around.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        I have a strong interest in Classics -- specifically Latin language and Roman
                                        culture. I studied Latin for six years, in middle and high school; I took up to
                                        Latin V. I took the AP Latin exam with a score of 4. I considered minoring in
                                        Classics at USC, but I wanted to have more open units for various electives.
                                        Since a computer science major took the majority of my units, not having a minor
                                        allowed me to study abroad with the extra units. I still love Classics, and have
                                        visited ancient sites like the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum in Naples and
                                        Knossos in Crete.

                                    <p>
                                        I'm currently learning to play the guitar. I have played the ukelele for about
                                        two years and I received a guitar as a gift. I've taken an intro course in
                                        guitar at USC, but I'm mostly teaching myself by looking at tabs of my favorite
                                        songs. I'd like to write my own, but inspiration needs to strike. Once I am
                                        proud enough with a recording, I'll post one of me playing here.
