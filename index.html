        <p>
            Hi! I'm Gwen, and I'm a senior in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (go Trojans!) I started coding by teaching myself python in 9th grade because they didn't let me take the computer science class at my high school. My favorite part of coding is definitely the problem-solving aspect - it's like solving a puzzle! My family will tell you that my childhood bookshelf was lined with sudoku and crossword puzzle books.

            Here are a few things I've worked on:

            <li><a href="#">Project 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Project 2</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Project 3</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can find the code for most of these on my github!
